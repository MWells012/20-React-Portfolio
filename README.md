# Description
Now that we've completed multiple projects within the bootcamp, it's time we test the knowledge and understanding we have gained thus far and create a new portfolio that can be used post graduation from the bootcamp to show employers what we are able to do with web development. This application was written with React.js, created through react-app and deployed via GitHub Pages.

# User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
